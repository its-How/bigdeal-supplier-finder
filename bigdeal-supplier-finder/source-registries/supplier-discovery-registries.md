# Supplier Discovery Source Registries

Seed registry of supplier discovery source families for the BigDeal Supplier Finder skill. These entries help agents choose where to search for suppliers; they are not endorsements of any platform, directory, or source.

## Boundary

**Does:**
- Seed source-surface recall for supplier discovery across six source families
- Record where B2B platforms, trade shows, associations, government directories, company websites, and media/community sources may be found
- Expose source metadata and source gaps as raw discovery signals

**Does not:**
- Recommend adopting any listed supplier or platform
- Prove source quality, safety, maintenance, or business readiness
- Replace candidate-level supplier review, due diligence, or procurement gates

## Family 1: B2B Platforms and Marketplaces

**id:** `b2b-platforms`

**Examples:** Alibaba, Global Sources, Made-in-China, DHgate, IndiaMART, ThomasNet, Kompass, EC21, TradeWheel, eWorldTrade

**Access notes:**
- Most platforms offer public web browsing without authentication for basic supplier listings
- Some platforms expose search endpoints with filters for product category, region, certification, and minimum order quantity
- Advanced features (contact details, RFQ, messaging) typically require free registration
- Platform-specific search syntax varies; prefer keyword + category + region combinations

**Useful for:**
- Broad supplier pool discovery for common product categories

- Region-specific supplier filtering (e.g., "Guangdong electronics manufacturer")

**Not for:**

- `{product} wholesale private label {platform name}`
- `{industry} B2B marketplace {country}`

**Caveats:**
- Listings may include trading companies mislabeled as manufacturers; cross-check with company websites

- Some supplier pages require login to view full contact details

**Status:** unverified
